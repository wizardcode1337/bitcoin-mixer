# Bitcoin Mixing Services - Enhance Your Privacy with TOR
# Introduction
Bitcoin transactions are not as private as they seem. Your wallet address can be traced, which is why using a Bitcoin Mixer (also known as a tumbler) is essential for anyone serious about privacy. These services break the link between your identity and your coins by shuffling them with others.

However, privacy can only be guaranteed when these mixers are accessed via TORâ€”the encrypted browser network that ensures anonymity. Below is a list of highly trusted Bitcoin mixing services and their TOR mirrors.

# Important: Always Use TOR to Access Bitcoin Mixers
For maximum privacy, never access these services through the regular web. Always use TOR, which ensures your identity stays hidden. You can download the TOR browser here.
